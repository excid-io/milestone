          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Worker safety is of paramount importance, especially regarding public 
            infrastructure such as roads, lights, power lines, and public buildings, 
            where workers are exposed to multiple danger sources such as weather 
            conditions and passing vehicles. The MILESTONE project offers a secure 
            AI-enabled worker safety preservation system, by leveraging Plegma Labs' IoT 
            platform that provides AI computer vision capabilities, coupled with ExcID's 
            data space platform that provides digital twining functionality, rich data access 
            API, and fine-grained access control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, MILESTONE will utilize real-time data from IoT devices, 
            such as cameras and drones, into an AI engine to monitor if public infrastructure 
            workers comply with the required safety rules, such as wearing helmets, 
            vests, gloves, and other protective gear, and will inform safety managers 
            with real-time alerts, leading to the prevention of serious accidents. 
            These IoT devices are strategically placed at public infrastructure sites 
            where workers operate on construction or maintenance activities. MILESTONE's 
            AI engine can identify irregularities, such as a worker without a helmet or 
            individuals entering a restricted area, and immediately alert safety managers. 
            MILESTONE's AI engine will utilize state-of-the-art computer vision models 
            with deep learning algorithms. Access to real-time data, will be mediated 
            through a data space enabler: a collection of modules that provide secure, 
            interoperable, and flexible data access. MILESTONE will leverage a 
            FIWARE-powered platform for this purpose.
